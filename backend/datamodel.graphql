# Any time you update this file it needs to be deployed to Prisma. `npm run deploy`
# Deploying generates `prisma.graphql`, based on the schema (is this file) that we provide in this file,
# which contains all of the relationships, types, queries, for the underlying CRUD operations.
# GraphQL doesn't provide this out of the box like filtering and fuzzy matching etc
# Post deploy hook in `prisma.yml` file pulls the new deployed (prisma.graphql) file back down
